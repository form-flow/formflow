# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

{/* <Subtitle /> */}
{/* <Description /> */}
<Primary />
{/* <ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} /> */}
{/* <Stories /> */}
